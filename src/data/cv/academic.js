    highlights: [
      'Devised a novel text entry method that composes scattered keywords into a natural and clear sentence, which may help exaggerate the importance of human factors in studying natural language processing by, in this particular project, observing how people consider keywords.',
      'Designed and developed a keyword extractor using BERT from huggingface.io. ',
      'Retrained the model based on the prompt-based approach to give three different semantic candidate sentences. ',
      'Developed a web application to enable more people to participate in our user study. Designed and implemented the UI with React framework. Stored data in MongoDB and used ExpressJS as the backend framework.',
