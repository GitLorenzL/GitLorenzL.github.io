Greetings! This is Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu, going by he/him/his. 

I am currently pursuing my **[Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/)** at the **[Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/)**. 
My work sits at the broad area of **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, with specific interests in: 

 - Reinforcement learning in human-AI interaction 
 - Interactive technologies in novel digital environments (extended reality, video games, etc.)

My most interested academic communities: **[ACM CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi)**, **[NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/)**.

My goal is to create intelligent interactive systems that prioritize the needs, capabilities, and perspectives of humans to enhance their overall experience and well-being.

Prior to this, I finished my undergraduate study at the **[School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University (Beijing, China)](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/)**, from which I receive my **B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology**.

For leisure, I enjoy playing cello and guitar; I also love billiard, basketball, cycling, swimming, soccer, and badminton.

# A Brief Explanation for My Interests 

I find [**this article**](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents) by [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/) extremely inspiring. 

Currently, most AI applications are just bots, not agents. Bots are passive, while agents are proactive; agents make suggestions instead of taking in prompts. Unlike bots, agents learn things in an online way, which means they improve over time because they gradually understand and recognize intent and patterns in your behaviour. Based on this information, they offer to provide what they think you need.

That's what I find strikingly intriguing.
