# Intro

Greetings! This is Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu, going by he/him/his. 

I am currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Applied Computing** at the **University of Toronto**. 
My work sits at the broad area of **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, with specific interests in **human-AI interaction**, **extended reality**, and **gaming technologies**. 
My goal is to create intelligent interactive systems that prioritize the needs, capabilities, and perspectives of humans to enhance their overall experience and well-being.

My most interested academic communities: **[ACM CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi)**, **[NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/)**. 

Prior to this, I finished my undergraduate study at the **School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University (Beijing, China)**, from which I receive my **B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology**.

For leisure, I enjoy playing cello and guitar; I also love billiard, basketball, cycling, swimming, soccer, and badminton. 

# What Is the Intersection of HCI and AI?

**In One Word:** Synergy.

**In One Sentence:** The intersection of HCI and AI represents a synergy between human-centered design and advanced machine intelligence, fostering seamless and intuitive user experiences.

**In One Paragraph:** The intersection of HCI and AI is a captivating convergence that brings together the principles of user-centric design and the capabilities of machine intelligence. At this intersection, HCI leverages AI to create interfaces that understand, adapt to, and anticipate user needs, leading to more intuitive and engaging user experiences. Through the use of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning, HCI becomes capable of providing personalized, context-aware interactions, ultimately enhancing the usability and efficiency of digital systems. This dynamic relationship between HCI and AI not only transforms the way we interact with technology but also opens up exciting possibilities for the future of user interface design and human-machine collaboration.
