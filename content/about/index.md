I am a **Human-Computer Interaction** Researcher, Software Engineer, Game Developer, Amateur Cellist, Novice Guitarist, Billiard Lover, Basketball Fan, and Cat Fancier.

I was born in **2001** in the beautiful city of Chengdu, China. I received my **B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology** from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/).

I design and develop interactive systems that facilitate the interaction between **humans, machines, and information**. My research aims to enhance the efficiency of human-machine interaction by creating **interfaces** that allow users to explore and explain data in a flexible and creative way, while also leveraging the scalability of **algorithms and machine intelligence**.
