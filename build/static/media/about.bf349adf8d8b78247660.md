# Intro

Greetings! I am currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Applied Computing** at the **University of Toronto** with a specific interest in **Human-Centered AI**. My work sits at the **intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI)**, and I use a mix of qualitative, quantitative, prototyping, crowd-sourcing, and speculative methods to understand how to design and interact with AI systems that amplify and augment human capabilities.

# What is Human-Centered AI

Human-Centered AI is the **bridge between HCI and AI**. 

It integrates human-centered design principles into the development of AI systems. This involves applying HCI principles, such as user-centered design and usability testing, to the design and evaluation of AI systems. It also involves applying ethical and social considerations to the development of AI systems, such as ensuring fairness, privacy, and security, and considering the broader implications of AI for society.

The joint force of HCI and AI can result in AI systems that are more usable, effective, and ethical, and that work in partnership with humans to enhance their capabilities. This integration can also help to build trust in AI technologies among users, by ensuring that the systems are transparent, understandable, and aligned with human values and needs.
